# Implementation of Machine Learning Methods for Network Intrusion Detection System
Our primary objective revolves around the development of a model adept at precisely recognizing malicious activities, leveraging the widely used KDD CUP’99 dataset. Through a meticulous comparison of diverse machine learning models, our primary emphasis lies in attaining optimal accuracy, with a specific focus on robust recall scores to counteract the potential evasion of detection by fraudulent cyberattacks. This research not only propels the evolution of effective intrusion detection systems but also directly responds to the urgent demand for heightened cybersecurity measures in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

- Investigated and enlisted multiple use cases where machine learning would fail to work as a trustable cyber security solution, using studies on techniques such as data poisoning and resource constraining.
- Implemented five known machine learning methods used to devise cyber security solutions, and improved them based on our findings as above, further improving the accuracy through methods such as balancing class distribution and anomaly detection techniques on certain misperforming parameters.
